# Usage Test Ledger

This file tracks end-to-end *usage* tests — sessions where the engine
is exercised as a real trader would use it, not by the unit /
integration test suite. Each scenario has a purpose, a setup, the
bugs and gaps it surfaced, and the PRs (if any) that closed them.

Companion to:

- `PROJECT_STATE.md` — current authoritative state.
- `ROADMAP.md` — intended next work.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — shipped per-PR detail.
- `TESTING.md` — the *unit / integration* test taxonomy. This file
  is the *usage* axis; that one is the *code* axis.

## How to update this

When a usage-test scenario completes:

1. Append an entry under the appropriate section with: name,
   purpose, setup, status, key findings, and follow-ups.
2. For each finding, link the PR that fixed it (e.g. `#102`) or
   tag it `**logged**` if not yet fixed.
3. Move scenarios between sections as their status changes
   (Candidate → Queued → In flight → Completed).
4. Keep findings inline under their scenario. Cross-cutting
   findings that recur across scenarios can be repeated; do not
   maintain a parallel flat index — it will drift.

The aim is operational, not historical: a fresh agent should be
able to read this and know which surfaces of the product have been
exercised and which have not.

## 1. Completed

### S1 — Single-snapshot trader session

**Purpose.** Exercise the morning-scan → dossier → sizing path as a
retail wheel trader would, top-down across the SP500.

**Setup.** `SWE_DATA_PROVIDER=bloomberg`, offline charts
(`FilesystemChartProvider`), 40-name diversified watchlist,
`as_of=2026-03-20`, $150k account, 35-DTE / 25-delta puts.

**Status.** Done. One critical bug fixed
(`#102` — dividend-yield normalization). Other findings logged.

**Findings:**

- **Dividend-yield normalization bug** (`wheel_runner.py` ~ line 655).
  Sub-1% yields skipped the `> 1.0` guard and reached BSM as a
  whole-number decimal (`0.87` used as 87% q). Corrupted the
  delta → strike solve and the synthetic premium across ~92 of 410
  priced names — MSFT, COST, AAPL surfaced as positive-EV when truly
  negative. Fixed in **`#102`** (merged `afee837`).
- **`Δ` (U+0394) Unicode crash** in `candidate_dossier.py`'s R3
  review note — crashes Windows cp1252 console on print / log.
  **Logged.**
- **Silent drops** — `rank_candidates_by_ev` returns only
  survivors; no diagnostic when a name is gated out (earnings,
  history, chain quality). **Logged.**
- **`as_of` footgun** — defaults to today; pairs stale Bloomberg
  prices with current-date event timing. **Logged.**
- **R4 reviewer rule effectively dead** in the standard ranker
  path — needs a `phase` field the ranker never emits. **Logged.**
- **Committee delta silent default** — `_build_advisor_input`
  falls back to `delta=-0.30` (`integration.py:165`) because the
  ranker emits no delta column. The 45-DTE figure in the original
  S1 note is an omission-only fallback (`integration.py:164`),
  **not** a live mismatch: the ranker emits `dte`, so the committee
  sees the correct 35. Corrected by S7. **Logged.**
- **No `ev_raw` exposed** in the ranker output despite being a
  core EV-engine field. **Logged.**
- **No return-on-capital column / no account-size input** — the
  ranker optimizes absolute EV/day, structurally biased to
  expensive names. **Logged.** Addressed in part by S4 (see S4).
- **Regime (HMM) multiplier unlabeled** — silently cuts EV
  50–80 % on some names with no surfaced regime. **Logged.**

### S2 — Multi-day rolling wheel campaign (4 weeks)

**Purpose.** Exercise the time dimension — managing a real book
across days: open, age, profit-take, hold, roll, accept assignment.

**Setup.** Bloomberg, offline charts, $150k account, 35-DTE /
25-delta entries, profit-take ≥ 50 %, max 25 % per name, 5-snapshot
window (`as_of` advanced 5 trading days per step) ending at the data
cutoff `2026-03-20`. Positions tracked in
`engine.wheel_tracker.WheelTracker`.

**Status.** Done. Dividend fix validated end-to-end in real flow
(4/4 closes profitable; PG loss landed honestly in the advertised
9 % tail). All management-layer findings logged.

**Findings:**

- **No persistence on `WheelTracker`.** No `to_dict` / `from_dict` /
  `to_json` / `save` / `load`. Closing a Python session loses the
  book. **Logged.**
- **No management-workflow methods.** No `suggest_rolls`,
  `suggest_actions`, `book_snapshot`, `available_buying_power`. The
  tracker is a mechanics layer (`open_short_put` / `close_short_put`
  / `roll_put` / `handle_*_assignment` / `mark_to_market`) without a
  management layer on top. The single biggest gap; addressed by S3
  (in flight).
- **`mark_to_market` silent IV-staleness.** Falls back to the
  position's entry IV when `current_ivs` is not passed — no warning,
  no `as_of` IV plumbing from the connector. **Logged.**
- **`tracker.cash` overstates buying power for CSPs.** Open credits
  the premium but does not reserve the strike collateral. Correct as
  brokerage cash; wrong as deployable capital. Workaround:
  `available = cash − Σ(strike × 100)`. **Logged.**
- **`get_performance_summary` is closed-positions-only.** Returns
  an empty DataFrame mid-campaign. No companion current-book
  snapshot. **Logged.**
- **Earnings-window-drift not surfaced** for open positions. A
  trade opened 50 days before earnings becomes "within window"
  silently as time advances. **Logged.**
- **Same-day close-and-reopen feels strange.** A name closed at
  profit-take can re-rank #1 in the same step and be reopened with
  no cooldown. Internally consistent (different contract entirely)
  but a UX surface a real trader would want. **Logged.**
- **Drop-reason silence carries into the rolling case** — same as
  S1, but more visible when a name disappears between snapshots.
  **Logged.**

### S3 — Build `WheelTracker.suggest_rolls(...)`

**Purpose.** Close S2's headline management-layer gap: when a short
put goes adverse, give the trader candidate rolls ranked by EV — not
just `roll_put` mechanics.

**Status.** Done — shipped in **`#104`** (merged `ece2717`).

**What shipped.** `WheelTracker.suggest_rolls(ticker, as_of,
current_spot, current_iv, ...)` enumerates roll candidates over a
DTE × delta grid, runs each through `EVEngine.evaluate` (§2 intact —
uses the EV authority; pinned by a call-count regression test), and
returns a DataFrame ranked by forward EV with `roll_ev`, `hold_ev`,
`net_credit_debit`, `prob_otm`, `recommend`. Short-put rolls only.

**Notes:**

- **EV metric.** `roll_ev = ev_dollars(new) − buyback_total`;
  `hold_ev = ev_dollars(synthetic) − buyback × 100`. Both express
  marginal forward dollar P&L from the decision moment — apples-to-
  apples. The original spec's `+ net_credit_debit` double-counted
  the new premium (it is already inside `ev_dollars(new)` via
  `gross_premium`); the shipped single-count form is the correct
  one.
- **`recommend` semantics.** `recommend=True` means "this roll's
  forward EV beats holding's" — **not** "this position needs
  rescuing". Correct for the intended use (call on a *challenged*
  position); calling it on a healthy position surfaces
  premium-harvest churn. A UX-framing note for any dashboard
  surfacing this.
- **Live demo.** The S2 campaign's underwater PG position (deep
  ITM, ~2 weeks to expiry) → the engine surfaces a ~+$1,661
  forward-EV improvement over holding. The week-2 signal the S2
  trader didn't get.

**Follow-up (queued):** `suggest_call_rolls` — the covered-call-leg
parallel, deliberately deferred from #104.

### S4 — Account-size-constrained book selection

**Purpose.** Force a return-on-capital lens by setting a realistic
small account ($50k retail) as a hard constraint, then try to build a
book from the ranking. Exercises the no-account-size / no-ROC gap S1
logged.

**Setup.** `SWE_DATA_PROVIDER=bloomberg`, offline charts, 36-name
diversified watchlist (11 GICS sectors, mega-caps through mid-caps),
`as_of=2026-03-20`, 35-DTE / 25-delta puts, `contracts=1`,
`include_diagnostic_fields=True`. $50k hard cap; each cash-secured put
reserves `strike × 100` collateral. The book is walked top-down off
`WheelRunner.rank_candidates_by_ev` output.

**Status.** Done. 30 of 36 names ranked, 20 of them positive-EV; the
ranker's top three by `ev_per_day` (FIX, MCK, BKNG) each demand more
collateral than the entire $50k account ($122.2k / $84.1k / $401.4k).
No bug — every figure computes correctly; S4 surfaces missing
*capability*, not a defect. All findings logged; no code change (a
usage test's deliverable is the writeup). The top-10 names by ROC —
CF, FIX, FDS, AJG, EXE, JBHT, EG, MCK, HUM, BR — are the sample S7
fed to the advisor committee.

**Findings:**

- **No account-size input — the ranking is capital-blind.**
  `rank_candidates_by_ev` (`wheel_runner.py:448`) takes `contracts`,
  `top_n`, `min_ev_dollars` — nothing for account size or a collateral
  budget. It returns an identical ranking for a $50k account and a $5M
  one. Optimizing `ev_per_day` with no capital term, it front-loads the
  most expensive names: a strict top-down walk (stop at the first
  unaffordable pick) opens **zero** positions and strands all $50k; the
  first candidate that fits at all is the ranker's #4. Nothing in the
  output flags that the top names are unbuyable. **Logged.** (the core
  S1 gap, now exercised.)

- **No return-on-capital column.** Output carries `ev_dollars`,
  `ev_per_day`, `prob_profit`, CVaR, Omega, `edge_vs_fair` and the
  dealer/skew/HMM diagnostics — but nothing dividing EV by collateral.
  ROC (`ev_dollars / (strike × 100)`) had to be hand-computed.
  Re-ranking by ROC reorders the book sharply: CF #8 → #1, EXE #12 →
  #5, against BKNG #3 → #18, MCK #2 → #8, CAT #7 → #12. The ranker's
  order and the capital-efficiency order disagree most on exactly the
  names a $50k trader must decide between. **Logged.**

- **ROC ordering beats ranker ordering on the same $50k.** A greedy
  fill down `ev_per_day` order fits 2 names (EG + FDS — $48.75k
  collateral, $666 EV). The same fill down ROC order fits 4 (CF + FDS +
  EXE + KO — $47.35k, $722 EV): +8.4 % EV, twice the positions (genuine
  diversification vs a two-name book), and less capital committed. The
  absolute-EV lens leaves both money and diversification on the table
  for a constrained account. **Logged.**

- **No buying-power / book-builder helper; `contracts` is global.**
  The collateral math, the budget walk and the ROC re-sort were all
  done by hand. S2 logged the workaround `available = cash −
  Σ(strike × 100)`; S4 confirms there is still no
  `available_buying_power()` and no "fit a book under budget X" helper
  for what is really a knapsack problem. `contracts` is one
  ranker-wide argument, not per-candidate — "as many contracts of the
  cheap names as the budget allows" cannot be expressed. **Logged.**

- **No concentration guard; $50k is structurally forced to
  concentrate.** The ranker-order book put 97.5 % of the account into
  2 names (EG alone = 60 %). S2 logged "max 25 % per name" as a
  trader-imposed rule the engine does not enforce — and under $50k that
  rule caps collateral at $12.5k/name, i.e. `strike ≤ $125`. Only 3 of
  the 20 positive-EV names (CF, EXE, KO) clear it at one contract. A
  properly diversified $50k wheel book is barely buildable from S&P
  names at current share prices, and the engine surfaces none of it.
  **Logged.**

- **`ev_per_day` is EV over the *effective* hold, not the 35-DTE
  nominal.** `ev_per_day = ev_dollars / expected_days_held`
  (`ev_engine.py:506`); `expected_days_held` is the
  probability-weighted blend profit→`dte/2`, stop→`dte/3`, hold→`dte`
  (`ev_engine.py:444`). For these high-prob-profit names the effective
  hold is ~17–19.5 days, not 35 — so `ev_per_day ≈ ev_dollars / ~18`,
  and `ev_per_day` order is *close to but not identical* to
  `ev_dollars` order (AJG outranks FDS on EV yet trails it on
  `ev_per_day`, its effective hold being longer). Neither metric
  carries a capital term; both front-load expensive names. Recorded so
  the ROC contrast is read against the metric the ranker actually
  sorts by — and so a future S4 reader does not mistake `ev_per_day`
  for `ev_dollars / 35`. **Logged.**

- **Silent drops recur, and bite harder under the constraint.** 6 of
  36 names returned nothing (NFLX, JPM, UNH, JNJ, GE, XOM); re-running
  with `use_event_gate=False` returns all 6 with `days_to_earnings`
  18–32 — earnings inside the option's life, correctly event-gated, 5
  of them otherwise positive-EV. Correct behavior, but invisible: the
  trader sees a 30-name list with no signal that 6 candidates were
  removed or why. Same as S1 / S2. **Logged.**

**Follow-up.** Shipped in #109 — `collateral` / `roc` columns on the
`rank_candidates_by_ev` output and `WheelRunner.select_book(...)`, an
account-aware skip-and-fill book selector. Both consume and subset
post-`EVEngine.evaluate` ranker output — neither rescues a candidate
nor bypasses the EV authority (§2-safe, pinned by a zero-evaluate-call
regression test). Deferred: per-name multi-contract sizing.

### S7 — Advisor committee deep dive

**Purpose.** Verify S1's logged committee/ranker contract-mismatch
claim, and answer the trader question: do four advisors disagree
usefully, or is the committee expensive noise on retail short puts?

**Setup.** Bloomberg, offline charts, `as_of=2026-03-20`, 35-DTE /
25-delta, top-10 ROC names from S4 (CF, FIX, FDS, AJG, EXE, JBHT,
EG, MCK, HUM, BR), fed through
`advisors.integration.EngineIntegration.evaluate_trade` — naive
caller, then a corrected caller emulating the `/api/committee` path
(delta from spot/strike/IV, `ev_dollars → ev_pct`). Plus 12
synthetic probes varying one input at a time. No code changes.

**Status.** Done. All findings logged (no fix this session).
Code-level claims verified by Cowork-B against source; runtime vote
patterns/probe reactions as reported by the executor run.

**Findings:**

- **Committee structurally pinned at neutral.**
  `_determine_committee_judgment` leaves neutral only on
  `approve_count > total/2` or `reject_count > total/2` — i.e.
  ≥3 of 4 (`committee.py:331,337`). Three advisors default neutral
  on retail short puts, so the verdict never escapes neutral on
  realistic ranker output. **Logged.**
- **`filter_approved(min_approval_count=2)` blocks 100% of
  positive-EV picks.** Keyed on each trade's advisor
  `approval_count` (`integration.py:117-141`); max observed
  approves = 1 (Munger), so it returns 0 trades at thresholds 2, 3,
  and 4. **Logged.**
- **The `EngineIntegration` helper has type bugs `/api/committee`
  already fixed.** The helper passes `ev_dollars` straight into
  `expected_value` (documented "Expected return %"), rendering
  $247.76 of EV as "247.76%". The API path converts
  `ev_dollars → ev_pct` (`engine_api.py:871,883`) and rescales vix
  fraction→percent (`924-931`); `_build_advisor_input` does
  neither. Fix belongs in `_build_advisor_input` so all callers
  benefit, not duplicated per endpoint. **Logged.**
- **Per-advisor signal is real but discarded.** Negative EV → 2
  rejects, crisis regime → 2 rejects, earnings-in-expiry → 1
  reject; the >50% aggregator throws away sub-majority dissent. A
  `committee_judgment="elevated_concern"` on ≥2 dissents
  (escalation — §2-safe) would surface it. **Logged.**
- **Ranker emits no `delta`/`theta`/`gamma`/`vega`/`iv_rank`.**
  Forces the helper's −0.30 delta fallback. The ranker selects the
  strike via a chain `delta` column (`wheel_runner.py:899-907`)
  but emits no delta in its output. **Logged.**
- **"Areas of agreement" is substring keyword matching, not
  semantic synthesis.** **Logged.**
- **Simons is binary-on-EV; the others binary-off.** Simons
  strong-approves on high EV without distinguishing 5% / 10% /
  50%; net committee ≈ `Simons_thinks_EV_high ? lean : neutral`.
  **Logged.**

### S8 — Wheel-cycle-to-completion

**Purpose.** Walk one full wheel cycle end to end — short put →
assignment → covered call → roll → called away — to exercise the
management-layer methods a multi-leg cycle needs
(`handle_put_assignment`, `open_covered_call`, `roll_call`,
`handle_call_assignment`, `mark_to_market`, `get_performance_summary`)
and see what the engine does *not* support once the position leaves
the short-put leg.

**Setup.** `SWE_DATA_PROVIDER=bloomberg`, `MarketDataConnector`. Single
name DIS, chosen for a clean dip-and-recovery in the Bloomberg window.
$30k account, `WheelTracker(require_ev_authority=True)`. Put leg routed
through `WheelRunner.rank_candidates_by_ev` (`as_of=2025-03-10`,
35-DTE / 25-delta) → EV-authority token → `open_short_put`. Timeline:
short put 2025-03-10 (strike $98); assigned 2025-04-14 at spot $84.66
(−$13.34/sh, basis $98); covered call sold 2025-04-15 ($92 strike);
rolled $92C → $112C on 2025-05-12 (spot $110.49, deep ITM); called
away 2025-06-20 at spot $117.63.

**Status.** Done. The full cycle completes and reconciles — net
**+$182.01** on $30k over 102 days: the covered-call premiums plus the
roll buying $20 of extra strike room ($92 → $112) turned a $13.34/sh
underwater assignment into a small green cycle. One genuine bug fixed;
the rest logged. The headline gap: **the wheel's second leg (covered
call) and the roll are entirely outside the EV decision authority** —
only the put entry is engine-ranked.

**Findings:**

- **No covered-call entry ranker — the call leg bypasses the EV
  authority.** `open_covered_call` (`wheel_tracker.py:777`) takes a raw
  `strike` / `premium`, has no `ev_authority_token` parameter, runs no
  `EVEngine.evaluate`, and there is no covered-call analogue of
  `rank_candidates_by_ev`. The covered call is a tradeable short option
  yet nothing ranks or EV-checks it. In this run the $92 strike and its
  premium had to be hand-picked and BSM-priced. The put leg is
  EV-authoritative; the call leg is unmanaged. **Logged.**

- **`open_covered_call` / `roll_call` apply no event gate.** DIS
  earnings 2025-05-07 fell squarely inside the covered call's
  [2025-04-15, 2025-05-20] life. The put leg is event-gated through the
  ranker's `EventGate`; the call leg has no equivalent — earnings
  inside a covered call's expiry are invisible to the engine. **Logged.**

- **`roll_call` has no EV / decision support.** S3 shipped
  `suggest_rolls` for the *put* leg; `suggest_call_rolls` was
  explicitly deferred (#104 follow-up, still queued). The cycle's roll
  ($92C → $112C, a −$1,534 net debit) was a pure-mechanics call with no
  roll-vs-hold-vs-let-assign EV comparison — the trader is on their own
  for the single most consequential covered-call decision. **Logged.**

- **The EV-authority token proves provenance, not tradeability.**
  `issue_ev_authority_token` (`wheel_tracker.py:168`) hashes and
  accepts *any* ranker row with no EV-sign check; `open_short_put`'s
  launch-gate (`wheel_tracker.py:241`) only verifies the token exists.
  The DIS candidate here had `ev_dollars = −$30.65` (surfaced only
  because the run used a relaxed `min_ev_dollars`) and `open_short_put`
  accepted it. §2 is not strictly violated — `EVEngine.evaluate` *was*
  called — but the R1 "negative EV → blocked" verdict, enforced in the
  dossier reviewer path, is **not** propagated into the token: the gate
  is "ranker-derived", not "ranker-approved". A token that encoded the
  verdict (or a positive-EV assertion in `issue_ev_authority_token`)
  would close this. Left for a human to scope — it changes the
  launch-gate contract. **Logged.**

- **`get_performance_summary` reported a winning trade as
  `largest_loss`.** `largest_loss` was `net_pnl.min()` over *all*
  trades, so an all-green book returned its smallest *win* as the
  "largest loss" (the single-trade cycle here showed
  `largest_win == largest_loss == $182`). `largest_win` had the
  symmetric flaw. **Fixed** in this PR — both are now taken over the
  winner / loser subsets, `0.0` when the subset is empty; covered by
  `tests/test_wheel_lifecycle.py::TestPerformanceSummary`.

- **`tracker.cash` overstates buying power** — confirmed (S2 / S4).
  After the CSP opened, `cash` read $30,129 while $9,800 of strike
  collateral was unreserved; deployable capital is `cash − Σ(strike ×
  100)`, still computed by hand. **Logged.**

- **`mark_to_market` IV staleness** — confirmed (S2), but mild in this
  cycle: at both mark dates the short put was deep ITM (spot $81.72 vs
  $98 strike), so vega was small and the entry-IV vs live-IV(0.55)
  marks differed by only ~$1. The gap bites on ATM / OTM holds carried
  through a vol regime change, not on a deep-ITM leg. **Logged.**

**Follow-up (queued).** A covered-call entry ranker (the call-leg
parallel of `rank_candidates_by_ev`) and `suggest_call_rolls` (the
call-leg parallel of `suggest_rolls`) would together bring the wheel's
second half under the same EV authority as the first. Both are §2-safe
by construction — they would *rank*, not rescue. Larger than a usage
test's remit; left for a human to scope.

### S9 — Adversarial / gate stress

**Purpose.** Attack each engine gate with inputs that should be
rejected and confirm it fails closed — drops or flags the candidate,
never emits a tradeable result. Gates: history, event, chain-quality,
stress-residual, survivorship.

**Setup.** `SWE_DATA_PROVIDER=bloomberg`, `as_of=2026-03-20`, 35-DTE /
25-delta. Per-gate probes through `WheelRunner.rank_candidates_by_ev`
(each gate's `enforce_*` / `use_*` flag toggled on vs off), plus direct
probes of `DataQualityFramework._check_options_consistency` and
`StressTester.greeks_stress_ladder`. No code changes.

**Status.** Done. No gate fails open. Four gates (history, event,
stress-residual, survivorship) were exercised live and each fails
closed; the chain-quality gate is structurally inactive on the
Bloomberg provider — no option chain to police — and its check logic
fails closed when probed directly. No bug, no fix; all findings logged.

**Findings:**

- **History gate — fails closed.** `enforce_history_gate` /
  `min_history_days=504` (`wheel_runner.py:614`; in-code, the
  survivorship-bias protection). Probe: GEV (497 OHLCV bars) and SOLV
  (498) — real 2024 spin-offs, both under 504 bars at `as_of` — with
  AAPL (2065) as control. Gate on → ranks `[AAPL]`; gate off →
  `[AAPL, GEV, SOLV]`. The short-history names are correctly blocked.
  **Logged.**

- **Event gate — fails closed.** `use_event_gate` → `EVEngine.evaluate`
  event lockout (`ev_engine.py:262`) → the ranker drops the row on
  `event_lockout_reason` (`wheel_runner.py:1056`). Probe: XOM, JPM,
  UNH, JNJ, GE, NFLX — all with earnings inside the 35-DTE window at
  `as_of=2026-03-20` — plus AAPL control. Gate on → `[AAPL]`; gate off
  → all 7. All six earnings-window names blocked. `EVEngine` does
  compute `event_lockout_reason`, but the ranker discards it on
  `continue` — see the silent-rejection finding below. **Logged.**

- **Chain-quality gate — logic fails closed, but dormant on the
  Bloomberg provider.** `enforce_chain_quality_gate`
  (`wheel_runner.py:843`) runs `_check_options_consistency` on the raw
  chain and `continue`s the ticker on any ERROR/CRITICAL issue. Logic
  probe: a degenerate chain (negative volume, IV 9.5, crossed
  bid > ask) → 3 ERROR issues; a clean chain → 0 — the gate would
  block. **But** `MarketDataConnector` exposes neither `get_options`
  nor `get_option_chain`, so on Bloomberg `chain_df` is always `None`
  and the gate at `:843` never executes. It is reachable only with a
  live-chain provider (Theta — S6); on the default provider it is a
  no-op, and the premium it would police is synthetic BSM anyway.
  **Logged.**

- **Stress-residual gate — fails closed; advisory, off the EV path.**
  The Greeks-decomposition residual gate lives in
  `engine/stress_testing.py` (`:639`), not in `rank_candidates_by_ev`.
  Probe: an extreme `greeks_stress_ladder` (spot ±35 %, `iv_shock=0.80`)
  → 8 of 9 rows tagged `reliable=False`,
  `attrs["residual_gate_passed"]=False`, `max_residual_pct ≈ 3.12`, and
  a `warnings.warn` fires; a mild ±1 % ladder → all reliable. The gate
  correctly flags Greeks the Taylor decomposition cannot attribute. It
  is **advisory** — it tags rows, never drops them — and never blocks
  an EV candidate. **Logged.**

- **Survivorship gate — fails closed; it is the history gate, not a
  membership check.** Probe: `[ZZZZ, NOTAREALTICKER, FIX, AAPL]` →
  ranks `[AAPL, FIX]`; the bogus tickers have no OHLCV and are dropped
  at the data-fetch step (`wheel_runner.py:593`).
  `rank_candidates_by_ev` runs **no constituent-membership check** —
  `get_universe()` (`data_connector.py:654`) is the union of tickers in
  the OHLCV / fundamentals / vol_iv CSVs, not
  `data_raw/sp500_constituents_current.csv`. Benign in practice:
  index-removed names (IPG, K, LKQ, MHK) have no OHLCV at all and
  cannot be ranked, while FIX — a genuine member missing from the
  stale constituents CSV — ranks correctly. Survivorship protection
  thus reduces to no-data-drop plus the 504-bar history gate; there is
  no data-freshness gate, though the Bloomberg data carries no
  stale-but-long delisted name to exploit one. **Logged.**

- **Rejections are silent — recurring S1 / S2 finding.** History,
  event and survivorship rejections are indistinguishable in the
  output: the candidate is simply absent, with no reason, count, or
  diagnostic — a caller cannot tell "gated out" from "never a
  candidate." Of the five gates, only stress-residual surfaces its
  verdict (a `warnings.warn` + `.attrs`); the chain-quality gate at
  least emits a `logger.warning` when it blocks. The three live ranker
  gates are fully silent. Same gap S1 and S2 logged. **Logged.**

### S10 — News-sentiment downgrade path

**Purpose.** Validate the news-sentiment overlay
(`engine/news_sentiment.py`, the only news module on the EV path):
confirm bad sentiment downgrades a candidate's EV, and — the §2
invariant — confirm good sentiment can never rescue a non-tradeable
candidate.

**Setup.** `SWE_DATA_PROVIDER=bloomberg`, `as_of=2026-03-20`, 35-DTE /
25-delta. Probe A — `NewsSentimentReader` against a synthetic store in
a temp dir, mapping `sentiment_multiplier` across the sentiment range
including the extremes. Probe B — `rank_candidates_by_ev` end-to-end
with `get_ticker_sentiment` monkeypatched to inject synthetic sentiment
(process-local; the real `sentiment_multiplier` and `wheel_runner`
wiring still run), `use_news_sentiment` toggled on vs off. No code
changes.

**Path.** `use_news_sentiment` → `NewsSentimentReader.sentiment_multiplier`
→ `news_mult`, folded into `combined_regime_mult = hmm × skew × news ×
credit` (`wheel_runner.py:933`) → `trade.regime_multiplier` →
`EVEngine.evaluate`, where `ev_dollars = ev_raw × regime_mult`
(`ev_engine.py:502`). News scales the final dollar EV; it never touches
`ev_raw`.

**Status.** Done. §2 holds — bullish sentiment (capped at +5 %) cannot
rescue a negative-EV or event-gated candidate. Bad sentiment downgrades
EV as designed. No §2 violation, no bug; all findings logged.

**Findings:**

- **News multiplier is clamped to [0.88, 1.05] — asymmetric,
  downgrade-biased.** `sentiment_multiplier` is a 4-value step
  function: sentiment ≤ −0.3 → 0.88, ≤ −0.1 → 0.95, ≥ 0.3 → 1.05, else
  1.00; `n_articles < 5` forces 1.00. Probed across the full range —
  even maximal sentiment (+1.0, n=9999) caps at 1.05, minimal (−1.0)
  floors at 0.88. Max downgrade −12 %, max boost +5 %, analogous to the
  dealer multiplier's [0.70, 1.05] (CLAUDE.md §2). §2-safe by
  construction. **Logged.**

- **Bad sentiment downgrades EV — confirmed end-to-end.** News-on vs
  news-off through the ranker: CF (bearish −0.6) `ev_dollars`
  247.76 → 218.03 (×0.88); AJG (−0.2) 326.57 → 310.24 (×0.95). The
  on/off ratio equals the emitted `news_multiplier` exactly — the
  overlay works as designed. **Logged.**

- **§2 holds — good news cannot rescue.** `ev_dollars = ev_raw ×
  regime_mult` with a strictly-positive multiplier is sign-preserving:
  a negative-EV name stays negative. Probe: MSFT (negative-EV) +
  maximally-bullish sentiment (1.05) → `ev_dollars` −24.47 → −25.69
  (still < 0), and MSFT stays absent from a `min_ev_dollars=0` ranking.
  Event-gated XOM + bullish news stays gated — the event lockout
  (`ev_engine.py:262`) precedes the multiplier. Because the multiplier
  scales signed magnitude, bullish news on a negative-EV name makes
  `ev_dollars` *more* negative — harmless for §2 (such names are
  non-tradeable regardless), but it means the multiplier is a magnitude
  scaler, not a directional tilt. **Logged.**

- **`n_articles < 5` → forced neutral (1.00).** FDS with +0.90
  sentiment but only 3 articles → multiplier 1.00, zero EV change. A
  genuine sentiment signal on a thinly-covered name is silently
  ignored. **Logged.**

- **No news store on the Bloomberg setup — the overlay is a dormant
  no-op by default.** None of `news_sentiment.py`'s `_CANDIDATE_PATHS`
  (`data_processed/news_sentiment.{parquet,csv}`,
  `data/news/sentiment.*`, `financial_news/storage/sentiment.sqlite`)
  exist; with `use_news_sentiment=True` (the default) every candidate
  gets a 1.00 multiplier. Absent news — no store, no row for a ticker,
  or only stale rows — collapses silently to neutral. **Logged.**

- **News time-handling — a PIT leak, plus silent staleness.**
  `get_ticker_sentiment` keeps only rows with `as_of ≥ now() − 72h`
  using wall-clock `now()`; the ranker's `as_of` PIT cutoff never
  reaches the news reader. A backtest at `as_of=2026-03-20` would
  apply *today's* news — look-ahead, the same family as S1's `as_of`
  footgun. Conversely, news older than 72 h is dropped to neutral with
  no warning. **Logged.**

- **The overlay is surfaced — but only conditionally.** Unlike S9's
  silent ranker gates, the applied multiplier is visible:
  `news_multiplier`, `news_sentiment`, `news_n_articles` are emitted —
  but only as diagnostic columns (`include_diagnostic_fields=True`).
  With diagnostics off, the news adjustment is invisible. **Logged.**

### S11 — Regime-shift stress

**Purpose.** Stress the regime machinery: anchor the ranker across the
April-2025 VIX spike and observe whether the HMM and dealer-positioning
multipliers actually track a real volatility shock.

**Setup.** `SWE_DATA_PROVIDER=bloomberg`, 35-DTE / 25-delta, a fixed
12-name diversified watchlist (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, JPM, XOM, UNH,
CAT, KO, PG, HD, CVX), `include_diagnostic_fields=True`.
`rank_candidates_by_ev` run at five `as_of` dates spanning the
April-2025 vol spike — 2025-03-20 (VIX 19.8, calm) / 04-07 (46.98) /
04-09 (33.6, peak window) / 04-24 (26.5, elevated) / 05-15 (17.8,
reverted). The regime-multiplier trajectory was probed with
`use_event_gate=False` (all names present each date); event-gate
behaviour probed separately on vs off. No code changes.

**Status.** Done. The HMM regime multiplier responds as advertised — it
cut EV ~80 % into the spike (cross-sectional mean 0.74 → 0.29) and
reverted (→ 0.69). The dealer, skew and credit overlays did not
respond — each pinned at 1.0 the whole way through. No multiplier was
provably wrong; no bug. All findings logged.

**Findings:**

- **HMM multiplier tracks the shock — works as advertised.**
  Cross-sectional mean `hmm_multiplier`: 0.74 (calm, 2025-03-20,
  VIX 19.8) → 0.29 (peak, 04-09; 04-07 hit VIX 46.98 — the steepest
  VIX run-up in the 11-year data window outside the 2020 COVID crash)
  → 0.69 (reverted, 05-15, VIX 17.8). At the peak most names sat at
  ~0.20 — `position_multiplier` is a posterior-weighted average of
  per-state weights {crisis 0.2, bear 0.5, normal 1.0, bull_quiet 1.25}
  (`regime_hmm.py:275`), so ~0.20 means ~100 % crisis-state posterior
  (a genuine classification, not a clamp). The HMM cuts EV up to 80 %
  into the spike and reverts. **Logged.**

- **Per-ticker, the HMM multiplier is jumpy — a noisy single-name
  signal.** `GaussianHMM(n_states=4, n_iter=20, random_state=42)`
  (`wheel_runner.py:862`) is seeded, so fits are deterministic — but it
  re-fits per (ticker, as_of) and the clean cross-sectional mean hides
  per-ticker cliffs: HD flips 0.21 (04-07, crisis) → 1.00 (04-09,
  normal) over two days while VIX held 33–47; PG and UNH stay at ~0.2
  on 05-15 after VIX reverts. The HMM models each *ticker's* return
  regime, not the market's, so single-name multipliers diverge from
  VIX — partly genuine idiosyncratic stress, partly fit sensitivity
  from the low `n_iter=20`. On any one name it is a noisy de-rater.
  **Logged.**

- **The HMM regime is unlabeled in the output — confirms S1.** The
  ranker emits `hmm_multiplier` (a bare number — 0.20 = an 80 % EV cut)
  with no companion `hmm_regime` label, even though `dealer_regime` and
  `credit_regime` label columns both exist. A trader sees the cut with
  no surfaced "crisis". S1 logged this; S11 confirms it and sharpens it
  via the asymmetry with the other two overlays. **Logged.**

- **Dealer & skew multipliers are inert on the Bloomberg provider.**
  `dealer_multiplier` and `skew_multiplier` were pinned at 1.00 across
  all five dates; `dealer_regime` was empty throughout. Both require an
  option chain; `MarketDataConnector` exposes none, so neither overlay
  ever computes — they cannot respond to any shock on Bloomberg. Only
  the Theta provider (S6) would activate them. Same structural dormancy
  S9 found for the chain-quality gate. **Logged.**

- **The credit-regime overlay is not as_of-aware — a PIT leak.**
  `credit_multiplier` / `credit_regime` were identical
  ('benign' / 1.00) across all five as_of dates, including 04-07 at
  VIX 46.98. `FREDAdapter.credit_regime()` (`fred_adapter.py:137`)
  takes no `as_of` — it returns one wall-clock value applied to every
  historical as_of, so a backtest across a credit-stress episode would
  never see the stress. Same family as S10's news PIT leak and S1's
  `as_of` footgun. **Logged.**

- **Net — on the Bloomberg provider the HMM carries the entire regime
  response.** `combined_regime_mult = hmm × skew × news × credit`
  (`wheel_runner.py:980`), but skew and dealer are pinned (no chain),
  credit is pinned (PIT-unaware), and news is pinned (no store — S10).
  Of the four regime overlays, only the HMM is both live and responsive
  on the default provider. **Logged.**

- **The event gate stays consistent across the shift — earnings-driven,
  not vol-driven.** With `use_event_gate=True`, survivors of the
  12-name watchlist were 8 / 2 / 2 / 3 / 10 across the five dates,
  tracking the Q1-2025 earnings calendar (April is peak earnings
  season → 9 of 12 gated) rather than the VIX — the gate behaves
  identically regardless of regime. (Aside: names within 5 days of
  earnings are soft-skipped even with `use_event_gate=False` — a
  second, separate earnings mechanism.) The stress-residual gate is not
  on the ranker decision path (S9). **Logged.**

## 3. Queued

### S5 — Live MCP chart in the loop

**Purpose.** Exercise the just-shipped TradingView MCP integration
(Stages 1–3 + live-verify fixes + `tv quote` price wiring) in a real
dossier flow.

**Setup.** TradingView Desktop running with CDP on
`localhost:9222`; tradingview-mcp `tv` CLI on PATH;
`SWE_USE_MCP_CHART=1`. Unlocks the `proceed` verdict that offline
sessions cannot reach. Operator setup required.

### S6 — Theta provider with real chains

**Purpose.** Exercise actual chain-quoted premiums vs the synthetic
BSM premium Bloomberg uses. `edge_vs_fair` is structurally 0 on
Bloomberg; S1 flagged this as the biggest missing signal.

**Setup.** `SWE_DATA_PROVIDER=theta` with the Theta Terminal running
on `127.0.0.1:25503`. Operator setup required.

## 4. Candidate (not yet selected)

Worth running when scope and time allow:

- **Strangle timing-gated strategy** — the `engine/strangle_timing.py`
  path (CLAUDE.md §4 timing-gated strategy). Not yet exercised.
- **Dashboard end-to-end** — the Next.js app under `dashboard/`
  not exercised at all. Would surface UX issues the API alone
  cannot.
- **TradingView webhook ingest** — `POST /api/tv/webhook` →
  ring buffer → `/api/tv/ranked` / `/api/tv/dossier`. The
  Pine-signal-driven entry path. Cold path right now.
